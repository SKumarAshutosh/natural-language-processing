        "### 1. What is NER?\n",
        "\n",
        "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a sub-task of information extraction that classifies named entities in text into predefined categories such as names of persons, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Input: \"Apple is planning to buy U.K. startup for $1 billion.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Output:\n",
        "- \"Apple\" → ORGANIZATION\n",
        "- \"U.K.\" → LOCATION\n",
        "- \"$1 billion\" → MONEY\n",

        "\n",
        "### What is NER?\n",
        "\n",
        "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is like highlighting the names of important things in a story or article. If you read a news article, NER will help underline names of people, places, companies, dates, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why and When is it Used?\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine you're quickly skimming through a newspaper and just want to know the main people or places mentioned. NER helps with this. Businesses use it to quickly understand documents, researchers use it to summarize content, and search engines use it to categorize information.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Is NER a Regression or Classification Problem?\n",
        "\n",
        "NER is a classification problem. Think of it like sorting candies by their colors. Each word (or candy) is given a label (or color).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Different Models for NER:\n",

        "   - Example: Conditional Random Fields (CRF) is a popular method here.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Deep Learning Models:** It's like a very observant person reading thousands of books and noting down names of people, places, and more. Over time, this person gets really good at spotting names.\n",
        "   - **RNNs:** Think of someone reading a sentence and remembering the previous words to guess the next word's type.\n",
        "   - **Bidirectional LSTMs:** The same as above, but they remember both previous and upcoming words.\n",
        "   - **Transformer-based Models (like BERT):** Think of a genius who's read millions of pages and can instantly tell you what each word in a new sentence likely represents.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Hybrid Models:** Combining rules, statistics, and deep learning. Like having a grammar book, friends' suggestions, and a keen observer together.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Ensemble Models:** Asking multiple people (or models) about names in a sentence and then going with the majority vote.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Pre-trained Models:** Imagine someone who's already an expert in recognizing names in English sentences now fine-tuning their skill to recognize names in science articles. That's how models like BERT are used for NER after being pre-trained on lots of general data.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Machine Learning Models:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Rule-based Systems:** These systems use hand-crafted rules (often regular expressions) to identify entities.\n",

        "    - **How they work:** Uses pre-defined rules, typically written as regular expressions, to identify entities in text.\n",
        "    - **Example:** A rule might state that any sequence of digits with a '-' in the middle is a phone number.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Decision Trees:**\n",
        "    - **How they work:** These models ask a series of yes/no questions about the data to make decisions. Each question splits the data into subsets until a prediction is made.\n",
        "    - **Example:** Is the word capitalized? If yes, it might be a proper noun.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs):**\n",
        "    - **How they work:** Assumes each word corresponds to a hidden \"state\" (like a part-of-speech or entity label). Transitions between states and the likelihood of a state emitting a particular word are learned from data.\n",
        "    - **Example:** If the current word is a verb, what's the likelihood the next word is a noun?\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Maximum Entropy Markov Models (MEMMs):**\n",
        "    - **How they work:** Like HMMs, but more flexible. Instead of just considering the current state's probability, they can consider multiple features and their combinations.\n",
        "    - **Example:** What's the likelihood of a word being a city name if it's capitalized and follows the word \"in\"?\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Conditional Random Fields (CRFs):**\n",
        "    - **How they work:** They're sequence models like HMMs and MEMMs but take the entire sequence into account when making a prediction for each word.\n",

        "    - **Example:** If you've seen \"New\" and you encounter \"York\", your context from previous words helps you label \"York\" as part of a location.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs):**\n",
        "    - **How they work:** They're specialized RNNs with mechanisms (called gates) that allow them to remember or forget information over longer sequences, solving the vanishing gradient problem of basic RNNs.\n",
        "    - **Example:** Even if many words appear between \"New\" and \"York\", they can still recognize and label them correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):**\n",
        "    - **How they work:** These apply a series of filters on local parts of the input data. For text, it means looking at small windows of words/phrases and extracting features.\n",
        "    - **Example:** Capturing local patterns like \"San Francisco\" as a likely location.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Transformer-based Models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa):**\n",
        "    - **How they work:** Uses self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different words when considering a particular word in a sequence.\n",
        "    - **Example:** If the sentence mentions several companies and then says \"its CEO,\" the model gives more weight to the company names to determine which company \"its\" refers to.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **CRF layer on top of Deep Learning models:**\n",
        "    - **How they work:** Deep models (like BiLSTMs) extract features, and a CRF layer uses these features to predict the best entity labels for the sequence, taking into account the structure and dependencies in the sequence.\n",
        "    - **Example:** Even if a deep model thinks \"Apple\" in \"Apple's new product\" is a fruit with high probability, the CRF layer can correct it to a company based on context.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Hybrid Models:\n",
        "\n",
